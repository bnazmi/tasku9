# Readme:
Below is a practical situation faced by an ordinary IT department. Read the functional requirement below carefully, and take your time thinking about how to approach it. You will be asked to build Forms, Reports, &/or pages to deliver a solution. Your full work has to be documented.
Please note that this is a real-life task, unlike the traditional academic tasks or problems. There is no standard way or only one right way to build a solution. Your documentation of the solution is highly critical and demonstrates your ability not to only technically solve the issue but rather professionally deliver it through the required documentation. The depth and extensiveness of your solution depend entirely on you.
The designated time for the candidate to have their final submission is 5 days from receiving the task, as mentioned in the Deadline.
## Functional Brief:
Fehrnana, the IT manager in HanaMantana Inc., is facing a tedious task. She has more than 150 different IT assets. She needs to register them in a registrar. In addition to the asset registrar, Fehrnana would like to schedule asset regular checks with preventive maintenance. Assets are classified into three classes (annually, quarterly, monthly). Each class has its own preventive maintenance frequency. Fehrnana would like the maintenance history for every asset along with maintenance report for every preventive maintenance event.
## Required:
Document & develop a solution for Fehrnana on Zoho Creator. Read the brief a couple of times, and always remember assumptions are very dangerous.
